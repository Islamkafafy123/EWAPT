# Introduction
- Authentication is determining whether somone who he calims to be or not
- its a protection mechanism that ensures that contents are accessed only if the user has the right to do so
- webapp rely on username and password to authenticate
- Diff between Authentcation and Authorization
  - Authentication : Verifying who you are
  - Authorization : what are you able to do
- Authentication Factor represent something the user owns , knows or is
  - ownership factor
  - knowledge factor
  - inherence factor
- Ownershio Factor
  - something the user has
  - Ex :- Security Token , Mobile Phone ,bank online token
- Knowledge Factor
  - Something the user know
  - Ex :- Password ,PIN or secret Question
- Inherence Factor
  - Something the user is
  - Ex :- Fingerprint Signeture , Face retinal Pattern
- Single Factor Authentication Method require user to provide single one of the three authentication methods
- Two Factor Authentication of MFA ( multi) require a user to provide two or more authentication method
  - like ATM (Pin And CARD )
# Common Vulnurabilities
- IF channel is not encrypted and attacker can steal creds using man in the middle attack
- if password does not adhere to strong password policy its exposed to attacks like ( Dictinary Attacks ,Brute Force Attack )
- Dictionary Attack
  - involve Quering the Authentication System With a wordlists
- BruteForce Attack
  - The Attack tries To use every Possible Combination of Charachters to guess the Password
- Defending From indequate password Policy
  - Strong Password Policy
    - length
    - never use the same password twice
    - dont include personal info
    - change password monthly or annualy
  - Storing hashes
    - password need to be hashhed with salt before they are stored
  - Lockout/Blocking Policy
    - block authentication Request Coming From and attacker
- User Enumration
  - user can authenticate to app if only user and password are correct
  - web app could reveal info about existing user
- Dont inform attacker about which credintial is wrong and make
- User Enumration via website behavior
  - if user exist new cookie is set if user is not present cookies are deleted
  - if user exist go to a user specific page if not present go to a known fixed page
  - if user exist html changes if not html is fixed
- User Enumeration via timing attack
  - if user exist in db there will be more processing
    - if user exist : retrieve user ,calculate pass ,check if pass is matching
    - if user dont exist : show error + abort
- Check Video
- check for default creds
- The Remember me Functionality
  - Through browser Cache
  - storng creds perma in web storage
  - storing creds within the cookie
- password must not be cached
- xss attack steal cookie if no httponly flag
- session hijacking via packet sniffing
- value stored in a cookie is much longer time that of session
- webstorage is a container accessable and writable by all pages sharing the same origin so attacker can acces it via xss
- Best Defensive Techniques
  - autocomplete off in html
  - encrypt password before storing it in the cookie
  - encrypt password before storing in the webstorage
