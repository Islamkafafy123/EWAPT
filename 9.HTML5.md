# Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- same origin policy (SOP) : is a policy implemented by browsers to prevent interactions between resources of different origin.
- CSS stylesheets, images and scripts are loaded without checking the SOP
- Browsers check the SOP when performing AJAX requests
- Within the Flash security model, a method to bypass the same origin policy has already been developed
  - An SWF animation on the origin a.com can access via Actionscript resources such as images and audio files on a different origin, b.com. This can happen only if the crossdomain.xml file allows this operation.
- `CORS` : It enables client-side cross-origin requests. by HTTP Header Called `Control Access Headers
- The CORS standard is used to enable cross-origin HTTP requests for
  - Ajax requests (through the XMLHttpRequest API)
  - Web Fonts (for cross-domain font inclusion via @font-face within a CSS)
  - WebGL textures
  - Images drawn using the drawImage API
- CORS is supported by all Browsers except Opera mini
- Cross Origin Ajax Request : `http://origina.ori/index.html`
```
function crossOriginXHRGet(){
var xmlhttpr = new XMLHttpRequest();
var url = 'http://originb.ori/page.html';
 xmlhttpr.open('GET', url, true);
 xmlhttpr.onreadystatechange = handler;
 xmlhttpr.send(body); 
}
```
- this request is cross origin because the requester (http://origina.ori/index.html) is different from the target (http://originb.ori/page.html)
- so the function cannot use js to read the page contents according to SOP
- this kind of access is allowed if HTTP CORS are used and set properly
- HTTP CORS Headers  Request type
  - Simple requests
  - Preflight request
  - Request with credentials
- Simple Request
  - It only uses GET, HEAD or POST HTTP methods,If the request method is POST, the Content-Type HTTP header must be one of the following
    - application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    - multipart/form-data
    - text/plain
- Preflight request : when it is not a Simple request
  - A PUT request
  - A POST request with Content-type set to application/xml
  - A GET request with a custom header such as X-PINGOTHER
  - need to send two HTTP requests : The first request is an HTTP OPTIONS
  - browser and web server use http origin header to negotiate permessions
  - HTTP Origin : called control access headers
  - By the use of the HTTP response header Access-Control-Max-Age, the browser will cache the result of the OPTIONS request to avoid sending alot of http request for subsequent request 
  - Example
  ```
  var xmlhttpr = new XMLHttpRequest();
	var url = 'http:// originb.ori/file.html';
	function handler(){
	. . . . 
	}
	function deleteResource(){
	 xmlhttpr.open('DELETE', url, true);
	 xmlhttpr.setRequestHeader('Front-End-Https', on');
	 xmlhttpr.onreadystatechange = handler;
	 xmlhttpr.send(body); 
	}
  ```
  - it will send non standered HTTP request (Front-End-Https) so it must be handeled as Preflight request
  - Brwoser will send two different HTTP Request
  ```
  Origin: http://origina.ori 
	Access-Control-Request-Method: DELETE
	Access-Control-Request-Headers: Front-End-Https
  ```
  - response will be checked by browser to make sure that the server allows the request type
  - Server Response will contain 200 and another response with the DELETE /File.html
  - because it boths allows The HTTP Verb and comes from authorized origin
  ```
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://origina.ori
	Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE
	Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Front-End-Https
	Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600
  ```
- By Default broswers dont send credentials in cross origin ajax request
- HTTP Cookies and HTTP Authentication Info are considered Credentials
- if devolper decided to include cred he must set flag with credentials with XHR invocation
```
	<script type="text/javascript">
	function handler() {
	. . . 
	}
	var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
	xhr.open("GET", "http://originb.com/home.html", true);
	xhr.withCredentials = true; ###################################
	xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;
	xhr.send();
	</script>
	
```
- Access control headers 
  - Access-Control-Allow Origin : `<domains>` or *  -->  access specific requester origin.
  - Access-Control-Allow-Credentials : True --> Request can be made with credentials
  - Access-Control-Allow-Headers
  - Access-Control-Allow-Methods
  - Access-Control-Max-Age 
  - Access-Control-Expose-Headers
  - Origin : contains (protocol, domain name and port)
  - Access-Control-Request-Method
  - Access-Control-Request-Header
- Access-Control-Allow Origin
  - Most important Http response Header and is set by target origin to allow access from a specific requester origin
  - Format
  ```
  Access-Control-Allow Origin : <Allowed Origin>
  ```
- WildCard that permit external scripts hosted on any site to access resources from the target origin
```
Access-Control-Allow Origin : *
```
