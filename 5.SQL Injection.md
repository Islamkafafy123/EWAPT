# Introduction
- a successfull SQLI lets attacker access and manipulate a web application backend database
- to interact with db webapps use the SQL
- SQL used to extract Data from DB
- webapps embed SQL Command is the server-side code know as queres
- the code takes care of establishing and keeping coonections to the db using the connectors
- connectors are midleware between the wepapp an the db
![connect](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/coonect.jpeg)
- SQL Statments
```
SELECT name ,description FROM products WHERE id = 9
```

- possible to select constant values from using the SELECT
- UNION --> perform union between two results
![union](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/union.jpeg)
- DISTINCT used to filter dubpicate
- UNION Applies DISTINCT by default
- comments in sql
  - #
  - (--) Two Dashes
- you can perform union operation with some choosen data
- to perform tasks form within the  web app we need to connect to the db first
  
![example](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/example.jpeg)

- most of time queres are not static they can be dynamic and vulnurable like this
  
![ex2](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/ex2.jpeg)

- the dynamic query
```
SELECT name, description from products where id = '$id'
```
- $id can be any value
- if attacker craft a payload like this
```
' OR 'a' ='a'
```
-so the query becomes  
```
SELECT name, description from products where id = '' OR 'a' ='a' ;
```
- this tells the db to check if id not equel any thing or an always true condition
- we can also exploit the union command
```
' UNION SELECT username ,password FROM accouns where 'a'='a'
```
- an attacker can read the the file system ,run os commands,install shells and basically own the whole infrastructre
- Types of SQLI
  - In band SQLI
  - Error bases SQLI
  - blind SQLI
- In band SQLI
  - levergae the same Channel Used to inject the SQL Code
- During in band SQLI we need to find a way to ask the web app for desired information
  
![inband](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/inband.jpeg)

- during the error based SQLI we need to force the DB to output an error and use this info to dig further
  
![error](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/error.jpeg)

- During blind SQLI the result of injection doesnt reflect on the output so we need to find an inference method

![blind](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/blind.jpeg)

- we can understand if the condition is true or false by studing the web app

# Finding SQLI
- we need to find where the injection point is
- we need to find the inputs and inject with charachters that are known to cause SQL Query to be invalid to produce error 
- sending a comma makes app throw error
- try to send string terminator ( ' and " ) or comments and check if app behave oddly
- every dbms respond  to incorrect sql queries with different error messages
- so should search for error and find which dmbs we are interacting with
- security through obscurity -- > use if secrecy of design ,implementation or configration in order ro provide security
- if the webapp dont output errors we can use boelen based detection techniques by crafting a payload to tranform queries to false/true condition
- Check Video and Example
# Exploiting In-Band SQLI
- In-Band SQLI are also known as union-based SQLI because they make use of UNION Command
- UNion Combine the result set of two or more SELECT Statment
- ALL used to avoid the effect of DISTINCT clause
- Note :
  - The field type of seconed SELECT STATMENT must match the one in the first Statment
  - the number of fields must match
![colu](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/colu.jpeg)
- iteratively add null fields until error disapears
- if the webapp dont display error we start with valid id and then
- now identifying field types
  - only mysql dont support type enforcing which is if the select statment is integer the union statment must be integer not string
  - we now have to subistitute one of the null fields with a constant
  - if the constant is correct the query will work if wrong an error will appear
- Check Video
# Exploiting Error-Based SQLI
- we will use MSSQL DB
- the error message contains the info we aims for
- the erroe message may not reflect in the webapp maybe in an email or a log file
- prevously we used errors to match conditions of failure/Success
- now we use error to retrieve db name ,schema  and data
- Schema are db with purpose of descriping all other user-defined db in the system
- in MSSQL sa is superadmin and has access to the master DB which contains schemas of user defined db
- first thing we need to know is the db version so we force an error to ouput the db version

![payload](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/payload.jpeg)

- after finding the db version we can search for it and find different column names
- now finding the current db user
```
9999 or 1 in (SELECT TOP 1 CAST (user_name() as varchar(4096))) --
```
- now enumrating the db user has
- first enumrate all db we can read
```
9999 or 1 in (SELECT TOP 1 CAST (db_name(0) as varchar(4096))) --
```
- db_name(0) gives all db user can read to enumrate all db user has access we just have to iterate db_name(1)
- now we enumrate the db tables with this payload
```
9999 or 1 in (SELECT TOP 1 CAST (name as varchar(4096)) FROM <databsename>..sysobjects WHERE XTYPTE='U' and name NOT IN <knowntableslist>) --
```
- XTYpe =U means we only interested in user defined tables

![tablelist](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/tablelist.jpeg)

![payload2](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/payload2.jpeg)

- To dump data
- retrieve the id values
  
![idvaluet](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/idvalue.jpeg)

- sending %2b to the wbapp means sending the (+) db and acts as a string concatination command
- we get id then we go filter like we always do after getting all the ids we begin enumrate the users and password
![pass](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/pass.jpeg)
- Watch video
- Mysql errorbased is differenrt from postgersql and from mssql so we need to find cheatsheet for every dbms
  
![mysql](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/mysql.jpeg)

# Exploiting Blind SQLI
- inferance method used to extract db schemas and data
- if the app dont print error it deosnt mean its vulnurable to blind sqli
- Time based SQLI
- Check Video
# SQLMAP
```
sqlmap -u <url> -p <injection parameter> [options]
```
- to exploit unionbased sqli
```
sqlmap -u <url> -p id --technique=U
```
- tells sqlmap to test id param with unionbased
- to exploit post request
```
sqlmap -u <url> --data=<post string> -p <parameter> [options] 
```
- save request from burp and use it using -r in sqlmap
- Check video
# Mitigation Stratigies
- Seperate Code From Instructions using bind variables in SQL
- implementing Prepared Statements

![prepstat](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/prepstat.jpeg)

- perform Type Cast
- input Validation
