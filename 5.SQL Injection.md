# Introduction
- a successfull SQLI lets attacker access and manipulate a web application backend database
- to interact with db webapps use the SQL
- SQL used to extract Data from DB
- webapps embed SQL Command is the server-side code know as queres
- the code takes care of establishing and keeping coonections to the db using the connectors
- connectors are midleware between the wepapp an the db

- SQL Statments
```
SELECT name ,description FROM products WHERE id = 9
```

- possible to select constant values from using the SELECT
- UNION --> perform union between two results
![union](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/union.jpeg)
- DISTINCT used to filter dubpicate
- UNION Applies DISTINCT by default
- comments in sql
  - #
  - (--) Two Dashes
- you can perform union operation with some choosen data
- to perform tasks form within the  web app we need to connect to the db first
  
![example](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/example.jpeg)

- most of time queres are not static they can be dynamic and vulnurable like this
  
![ex2](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/ex2.jpeg)

- the dynamic query
```
SELECT name, description from products where id = '$id'
```
- $id can be any value
- if attacker craft a payload like this
```
' OR 'a' ='a'
```
-so the query becomes  
```
SELECT name, description from products where id = '' OR 'a' ='a' ;
```
- this tells the db to check if id not equel any thing or an always true condition
- we can also exploit the union command
```
' UNION SELECT username ,password FROM accouns where 'a'='a'
```
- an attacker can read the the file system ,run os commands,install shells and basically own the whole infrastructre
- Types of SQLI
  - In band SQLI
  - Error bases SQLI
  - blind SQLI
- In band SQLI
  - levergae the same Channel Used to inject the SQL Code
- During in band SQLI we need to find a way to ask the web app for desired information
  
![inband](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/inband.jpeg)

- during the error based SQLI we need to force the DB to output an error and use this info to dig further
  
![error](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/error.jpeg)

- During blind SQLI the result of injection doesnt reflect on the output so we need to find an inference method

![blind](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/blind.jpeg)

- we can understand if the condition is true or false by studing the web app

# Finding SQLI
- we need to find where the injection point is
- we need to find the inputs and inject with charachters that are known to cause SQL Query to be invalid to produce error
