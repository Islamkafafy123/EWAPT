# Introduction
- Adobe Flash is a technology used to create video, animations and other rich content.
- can be used as standalone applications or be embedded in HTML pages.
- Adobe provides a `scripting language called ActionScript
- Flash ActionScript needs to be compiled before execution. The compiled object is in SWF format
- To embed a Flash animation within a web page, you can use an object element with Content-type : application/x-shockwave-Flash
- HTML page can embed the Flash animation and specify a param element with the attribute `allowScriptAccess` to describe the policy for communication between the animation and the parent HTML page
- allowScriptAccess
	- Always : The SWF file can always communicate with the HTML page
	- sameDomain : communicate with the HTML if they share the same domain.
	- Never : The SWF file can never communicate with the HTML page
- pass arguments to Flash files
  - Direct reference : Flash is not embedded in an HTML page and arguments are provided directly through the URI
  - Flash Embedded in HTML page : arguments are passed through the attribute data  of the object element.
  - FlashArgs attribute : Flash is embedded in the HTML page and arguments are passed through the attribute FlashArgs of the object element
# Flash Security Model
- Sandbox and stakeholder important concepts in the Flash security paradigm
- By default, SWF files hosted on the subdomain
- StakeHolders
  - describe different roles (human or not) involved in the control of security settings.
	- There are four stakeholders: administrator, user, website, and author.
	- Flash security checks are performed, starting from the first stakeholder
	- Each stakeholder can enforce security controls using different means.
- Administrative Rule 
	- Who :
		-  configure Flash security settings that will affect all operating system users.
	- How : 
		- `mms.cfg` : This text configuration file is read when Flash player starts,
		-  `The Global Flash Player Trust director` : Administrators can register SWF files as trusted for all operating system users.
- User Rule
	- Who : 
		- The user role is represented by the operating system user running a Flash animation through the player
	- How : 
		- Settings manager, Settings UI , such as: camera and microphone settings, shared object storage settings, settings related to legacy content, and so on.
		- User Flash Player Trust directory : Users can register SWF files as trusted
- Website Rule
	- Who :
		- web server component responsible for the delivery of the Flash animation and/or Flash resources to the client.
	- How :
    - Policy File : is a file placed in a specific location on the web server
    - `Note` that this policy file can grant or deny access to resources stored on the current server enforcing the policy.
    - such as : SWF (images, text files, or other SWF files).
    - Depending on the requested resource, ActionScript can initiate two different types of connection:
      - Document-based server connection for ActionScript objects
        - Loader (to load SWF files or images JPG,PNG,GIF)
        - Sound
        - URLLoader (to load text or binary data)
        - URLStream
      - Socket connection for ActionScript objects
        - Actionscript socket
        - XMLSocket
