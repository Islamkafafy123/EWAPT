# 2.1 HTTP/S
- Client-Server Protocol
- Client(Web Browser) / Server ( MS IIS \ Apache HTTP server)
- Client Sends Requests and server Rosponds with a Response
- \r moves cursor to begining of the line , \n moves cursor down the next line
- \r\n like pressing "ENTER" on the Keyboard

 ![request](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/request.jpeg)
- connection to google is initaited first before sending the HTTP commands to the webserver
- request type here is  " GET " (Default Request When Typing URL in the location bar )
-  " / " this is the file we are Requesting Which is the root folder of the website
-  " HTTP/1.1 " This is the HTTP Protocol version the browser uses ( tells the webserver which version to communicate with )
-  the begining of the  HTTP request headers  Starts With the  " Host " header  allow websever to host multiple websites at a single IP address
-  the browser specifes in the host header which website we are interested in
-  Host Header Value + Path compine to create full URL
-  " User-Agent " reveals browser version , OS , Language to The Remote Server .
-  " Accept " -> which docomunt type is expected to be returned as a result of the request
-  " Accept-Encoding " restricts the content coding the are accepted in the response
-  content coding allow a document to be commpressed or transformed without losing the identity of its media type
-  keep-alive in the " Connection " header means that connection to the wevserver will continou to be sent without starting a new connection every time
-  the web server will respond to the request with a respone with bunch of new headers

  ![response](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/response.jpeg)
-  The first line of the response is the status line consist of protocol version (HTTP\1.1) + numeric code ( 200 -> which means OK )

  
  ![status code](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/status%20code.jpeg)
-  Document transmited via HTTP can send charset paramater in the header to specify the charachter encoding
-  HTML Entity To show the sympol directly to the user without interpreting it 

-  Date Header represent when was the message originated
-  cache header allow the browser and the server to agree about caching rules
-  content Type lets the the client know how to interpret the body of the message
-  content encoding extends content type incase the message is compressed with gzip
-  server header displays the webserver banner ( google uses custom webserver banner gws (google web server ) )
-  content lengh - > lengh in bytes of the message body
-  on firefox -> devolper tools -> network ( all request and responses will be listed here of any connection initiated )
-  HTTPS is way to secure HTTP (HTTP over SSl\TLS)
-  attacker cannot sniff or alter the data on application layer
-  HTTPS doesnt protect against web app flaws (XSS\SQLI)
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2.2 Encoding
- charset -> sympols and code points
- sympol -> user reads
- code points -> numeric index
- ASCII cannot use to display chinese sympols
- UniCode enables peaple around the world to use computer in any language
- Charachter Encoding -> representation in bytes of the symbol of the charset
- Unicode UTF (Unicode Transformation Format )
 ![UTF](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/UTF.jpeg)
- HTML Entity -> when browser encounter an entity it will show the sympol to the user without interpreting it
  
 ![HTML Entity](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/HTML%20Entities.jpeg)

 - Browser encode user request diffrently

![browser encode](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/Urlencodebrowsers.jpeg)

- Base64 -> convert binary files and send them over the internet the email protocol uses it
- an image can be included in a page by inserting its binary that has been converted to base64
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 # 2.3 Same Origin Policy
 - prevents a script or a document from getting or setting properties of another document  from another origin
 - CSS stylesheet ,images and scripts are loaded by browser without consulting the policy
 - The origin is defined by three :
   - protocol
   - Host
   - port
 - The heirachy of domains from right to left
![origindef](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/origindef.jpeg)
 - the default port is 80
 - SOP Examples
![sopexmp](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/sopexmp.jpeg)

 - internet explorer has exception
   - doesnt cosider port as same origin component
   - the same origin dont apply to domains that are highly trusted (corporate domains )
 - SOP prevent JS running on given origin from interacting with document from diffrent origin
 - SOP isolates Request coming from different origin
 - Browser always perform request successfully but return response only when SOP is Respected
 - Document from above include : htmp page ,iframe in the main page or response to an ajax request
 -  **Again images ,stylesheet(.css) and js files are excluded from SOP**
 -  Excepptions To SOP
    - window.location
    - document.domain
    - Cross window Messaging
    - Cross origin resource sharing (CORS)

   # 2.4 Cookies
   - HTTP is stateless to overcome this and make it statefull cookies were introduced
   - cookies are stored in the cookie jar in the browser
   - they are fragment of text contain variables in the format ( Name = Value )
   - server sets cookie via Set-Cookie HTTP header field in the response message
     
  ![cookie](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/cookie.jpeg)   
   - website only sets cookie for its domain and any subdomains
   - in the domain field if a leading " . " is present , its ignored
   - if server doesnt specify the domain attribute , the browser will automaticlly set the domain as the server domain and set the cookie "host-only " Flag this means that the cookie will be sent to the precise hostname
   - cookie will be sent to the server if its not expired
   - session cookie expires when the session exits
   - the cookie path field specifes for which request within that domain the browser need to send the cookie for
     
![path](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/path.jpeg) 

   - server can set multiple values with a single " Set-Cookie " header
   - HttpOnly flag force browser to send cookie only through http ( to prevent cookie stealing via js ,flash ,java and any non-html technology
   - secure flag force to send over HTTPS
   - the domain attribure represent the domain value for which the cookie is valid
   - Cookies Domain Settings
   - First-> Cookie domain is specified
      - cookie domain value = target domain
      - cookie domain is different from target AND cookie domain value is a suffixof the target domain
   - for setting the cookie target domain " *.elswapt.site " can set cookie with domain value " elswapt.site "
   - for setting the cookie target domain  " elswapt.site " cannot set cookie with domain value " *.elswapt.site "
   - so lower level subdomain can set cookie for higher domains but not vice versa higher domain cannot
   - Second -> Cookie domain is unspecified
     - when cookie doesnt contain domain value its assumed that hostOnly flag is set to true
   - Third -> Internet Explorer Exception
     - IE doesnt distinguesh between cookies with specified domain from ones that are unspecified
     - cookies with unspecified doamin will be interpreted as if they had the domain value = the target domain set in it

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # 2.5 Sessions
  - Cookies are stored in the client side while session are stored in the server side
  - session variables expires when the session ends so they expire sooner than cookies
  - session id provided by the client will let the server retrieve both the state of the client and all its associated variables
  ![sessionid](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/sessionid.jpeg)
