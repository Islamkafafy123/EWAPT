# 2.1 HTTP/S
- Client-Server Protocol
- Client(Web Browser) / Server ( MS IIS \ Apache HTTP server)
- Client Sends Requests and server Rosponds with a Response
- \r moves cursor to begining of the line , \n moves cursor down the next line
- \r\n like pressing "ENTER" on the Keyboard

 ![request](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/request.jpeg)
- connection to google is initaited first before sending the HTTP commands to the webserver
- request type here is  " GET " (Default Request When Typing URL in the location bar )
-  " / " this is the file we are Requesting Which is the root folder of the website
-  " HTTP/1.1 " This is the HTTP Protocol version the browser uses ( tells the webserver which version to communicate with )
-  the begining of the  HTTP request headers  Starts With the  " Host " header  allow websever to host multiple websites at a single IP address
-  the browser specifes in the host header which website we are interested in
-  Host Header Value + Path compine to create full URL
-  " User-Agent " reveals browser version , OS , Language to The Remote Server .
-  " Accept " -> which docomunt type is expected to be returned as a result of the request
-  " Accept-Encoding " restricts the content coding the are accepted in the response
-  content coding allow a document to be commpressed or transformed without losing the identity of its media type
-  keep-alive in the " Connection " header means that connection to the wevserver will continou to be sent without starting a new connection every time
-  the web server will respond to the request with a respone with bunch of new headers

  ![response](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/response.jpeg)
-  The first line of the response is the status line consist of protocol version (HTTP\1.1) + numeric code ( 200 -> which means OK )

  
  ![status code](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/status%20code.jpeg)
-  Document transmited via HTTP can send charset paramater in the header to specify the charachter encoding
-  HTML Entity To show the sympol directly to the user without interpreting it 

-  Date Header represent when was the message originated
-  cache header allow the browser and the server to agree about caching rules
-  content Type lets the the client know how to interpret the body of the message
-  content encoding extends content type incase the message is compressed with gzip
-  server header displays the webserver banner ( google uses custom webserver banner gws (google web server ) )
-  content lengh - > lengh in bytes of the message body
-  on firefox -> devolper tools -> network ( all request and responses will be listed here of any connection initiated )
-  HTTPS is way to secure HTTP (HTTP over SSl\TLS)
-  attacker cannot sniff or alter the data on application layer
-  HTTPS doesnt protect against web app flaws (XSS\SQLI)

# 2.2 Encoding
- charset -> sympols and code points
- sympol -> user reads
- code points -> numeric index
- ASCII cannot use to display chinese sympols
- UniCode enables peaple around the world to use computer in any language
- Charachter Encoding -> representation in bytes of the symbol of the charset
- Unicode UTF (Unicode Transformation Format )
 ![UTF](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/UTF.jpeg)
- HTML Entity -> when browser encounter an entity it will show the sympol to the user without interpreting it
  
 ![HTML Entity](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/HTML%20Entities.jpeg)

 - Browser encode user request diffrently

- Base64 -> convert binary files and send them over the internet the email protocol uses it
- an image can be included in a page by inserting its binary that has been converted to base64
