# Weaknesses of session identifier
- since HTTP is stateless most web app use libraries ,cookies ,etc.. to keep track of user session
- session identifier is the unique key that identifies the use session within database of sessions
- Strong Session Identifier
  - Valid For only single session
  - Time limited
  - purly Random
- dont store session tokens in urls ,html,html5 web storage
# Session Hijacking
- refers to exploitation of a valid session assigned to a user
- can be done
  - using XSS
  - packet sniffing
  - gaining direct access to filesystem where session are stored
  - finding session id in logs or browser history
- if session identifier is too weeb the attacker can bruteforce the session id
- session id are typically carried back and forth using urls and cookies
- Session Hijacking Through XSS
  - XSS vulnurabilty exists
  - session id is sent through cookies in each http request
  - cookiesare readable by javascript
- to prevent this attack use http only flag
- Starting from .net 2.0 httponly flag is set by default
- Session Hijacking Via Packet Sniffing
  - victim Http Traffic can be sniffed
  - http trafic must be unencrypted
# Session Fixation
- session hijacking attack the attacker fixates a session id and force the victim to use it
- so divided to
  - the attacker obtains valid session id '\
  - the attacker forces the victim to use it to establish a personal session with the webserver
- the attacker craates session id and force victim to use it
- most web app are designed to start a new session for the first time a user visits the website regardless the user is authenticated or not
- to prevent session fixation
  - genarate a new session after any authenticated operation is made
