# Intro
- Attacks triggerd by users are called input validation Attacks
- malicous input can supvert the functionality of the program because of insuffecient validation By the (Application or the server )
- input validation attack include XSS ,SQLi ,HTTP header Tampering
# Cross Site Scripting
- ultimate purpose to inject html or run code Js in the user browser
- can be called Html Injection
- The $GET variable used to store <parameter,value> passed through the http get method
- Get is the method when clicking links or directly typing website url
- when using payload make sure its url-encoded
- why XSS happen ? because user input is given an output without any kind of sanitization
# Anatomy of XSS 
- XSS can be exploited to :
  - Cookie stealng
  - getting complete control over the website
  - perform keylogging
- to perform xss we need to make sure that the authenticated app is indedd in the domain field in the cookie
- if the process is diffcult we can use image

# Three types of XSS
- Reflected XSS
  - Occurs when untrusted userdate is sent to the web app and immpediaty displayed as untrusted content
  - the broswer recives the code from the webserver and renders it '
  - deals with server side code
  ![refxss](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/refxss.jpeg)
  - in reflected or stored the victim bring the payload in their http request to the vulnurable website
   - there are many techniques to camouflage the url
     - tinyurl
     - iframe located in a third party
     - link in a targeted mail
- most of time the reflected xss is used to steal seassions id stored in cookies or coikie itself
  ![refxss1](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/refxss1.jpeg)
- Stored XSS
  - same as refleceted but rather than the malicous input is reflected its being stored within the web application
  - deals with server side code
  - its an attack lead to execution of code in all users browsers visiting the vulnurable webpage
  - the malicous code is injected directly into the webapp
  - stored xss can alter and deface the web app original apperance while reflected will deface for the victim carrying the payload

- DOM XSS
  - opject created by the browser upon parsing the web page content provide by the server
   ![dom](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/dom.jpeg)

  -  exists in client side code
  -  lives within the dom enviroment within the client side and dont reach server side
  -  similer to reflectd  but without interacting with the server
  -  key in exploiting is that the client side code can acces the browser dom
  -  getelementbyid are dom function that lets us navigate through the page in a hierichal view
  -  node may have children as well as a father and may have attributes
  -  dom xss differ from other types because they are not caused by coding mistakes in the server side
  -  (reflected and stored ) xss are allowed when js code use usersupplied data as part of its logic
  -  dom bases can also be used to steal confidential data or hijak user account
  -  js code can use the querystring provided to the webpage as input to perform differnet operations
  -  pormpt() is used to gather user input
  -  when userinput is part of queryand given to be outputed through document.write and other varients its possible to inject(malisous)  aribitrary content in the webpage
  -  this attack dont require any interaction with the server
  - dom based can be persistant if the malisous payload is saved in te cookie
# Finding XSS
- reflected xss we just have to find what data gives output upon user supplied input
- we will try to inject into the input like
  - GET/POST variables
  - Cookies variables
  - HTTP Headers
- input from get method is the easiest
- try simple payload like <plaintext> and try to make the webpage unreadable and instruct the  broswer to treat the webpage as plaintext
- seceond step is to provide script injection
- input validation may allow tag plaintext but block tags like iframe or img
- if we have source code we need to look for all the point where the app output data supplied by the user and trace it back to the source and check if sanitzation is made or integer conversion
- take into consideration data that comes from the databse that may result in stored xss
