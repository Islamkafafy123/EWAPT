# Intro
- Attacks triggerd by users are called input validation Attacks
- malicous input can supvert the functionality of the program because of insuffecient validation By the (Application or the server )
- input validation attack include XSS ,SQLi ,HTTP header Tampering
# Cross Site Scripting
- ultimate purpose to inject html or run code Js in the user browser
- can be called Html Injection
- The $GET variable used to store <parameter,value> passed through the http get method
- Get is the method when clicking links or directly typing website url
- when using payload make sure its url-encoded
- why XSS happen ? because user input is given an output without any kind of sanitization
# Anatomy of XSS 
- XSS can be exploited to :
  - Cookie stealng
  - getting complete control over the website
  - perform keylogging
- to perform xss we need to make sure that the authenticated app is indedd in the domain field in the cookie
- if the process is diffcult we can use image

# Three types of XSS
- Reflected XSS
  - Occurs when untrusted userdate is sent to the web app and immpediaty displayed as untrusted content
  - the broswer recives the code from the webserver and renders it '
  - deals with server side code
  ![refxss](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT/blob/main/pictures/refxss.jpeg)
  - in reflected or stored the victim bring the payload in their http request to the vulnurable website
   - there are many techniques to camouflage the url
     - tinyurl
     - iframe located in a third party
     - link in a targeted mail
- most of time the reflected xss is used to steal seassions id stored in cookies or coikie itself

- Stored XSS
  - same as refleceted but rather than the malicous input is reflected its being stored within the web application
  - deals with server side code
  - its an attack lead to execution of code in all users browsers visiting the vulnurable webpage
  - the malicous code is injected directly into the webapp
  - stored xss can alter and deface the web app original apperance while reflected will deface for the victim carrying the payload

- DOM XSS
  -  exists in client side code
  -  lives within the dom enviroment within the client side and dont reach server side
  -  similer to reflectd  but without interacting with the server
  -  key in exploiting is that the client side code can acces the browser dom
