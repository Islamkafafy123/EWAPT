# Gather Info About Target
- info like
  - infrastructure
  - application logic
  - ips,domains,subdomains
  - virtual Hosts
- Gatther info about organization
- WHOIS Lookup
- WHOIS runs on TCP 43 port
- After WHOIS we got IP so We Go to DNS Query for the ips we foound
- DNS queries produce list called resource record
- ![resource record](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/resource%20record.jpeg)
- NSLookup is a tool to translate hostname to ipadrres
- Find Target ISP using Netcraft
- check video web app info Gather
# Infrastructre
- Discover What kind of web server running
- two most commen application are apache and microsoft iis
- discovering iis we will know that server running using os in the windows server family
- apache can be linux not sure
- iis components called isapi extensions **extending functionalites of the web server** like URL rewriting
  
![url rewriting](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT-EWAPTX/blob/main/pictures/url%20rewriting.jpeg)
- we can use netcraft to fingerprint the webserver from the domain provided
- nameserver is the dns server that replies to all lookup queires regardless the **nslookup -type=NS microsoft.com**
- in case of internal webserver netcraft cannot be used we use different techniques( netcat,httprint,whatweb,wappalyzer) they probe the webserver with a series of request and compare the respone to thier database of signitures
- Netcat establish connection to the webserver and look at the server field
- look at the x-powered by header
- cookies are intersting resource that is worth checking
- Whatweb used to recognize website technologies
# fingerprinting webserver modules
- url rewriting is done on apache using mod_rewrite module or .htaccess
- on iis url rewriting is handeled by ionic isabi rewrite or helicon isapi rewrite
- input validation attack is the use of malformed input using the url paramater
- not having the real url but just the rewritten one will make it difficult but still possible using other channels like forms,cookie and headers.
- search engine friendly url can be reversed engineer the translation rules
- input from forms can be tampered
# enumrating subdomain
- netcraft can be used to enumrate subdomain
- **enumrate with google**
  - site:.microsoft.com
  - site:.microsoft.com -inurl:www.
  - (-) operator means delete
  - site:.microsoft.com -insite:www.microsoft.com
  - Tools
    - subbrute
    - dnsrecon
    - the harvester
    ( these tools are useful for internal pentest )
- ZoneTransfer : process by which dnszone file are copied from primary dns server to secondry dns server ,they are result of misconfigration and should be enabled only to trusted ip addresses
  - **nslookup -type=NS microsoft.com** --> windows
  - Dig on Linux
  - Check video of subdomain enum
# Finding Virtual Hosts 
- Virtual Hosts are website that share ip addres with diffrent virtual hosts
- these hosts can be doamin or subdomains
  
![virtual hosts](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/virtualhosts.jpeg)
- Fierce is atool to find virtual hosts
# fingerprinting frameworks and application
- after finding subdoamins ,virtualhosts .. etc we start looking at each webpages from them
- Commen app are software pieces available online for anyone to use (COTS)
- inhouse apps the logic is based on guessing
- look for available explits online for the current version (exact version)
- we need to browse the website and look at its logic,appearances and urls
- look at the application name in the web page content
- look at the web page source name and version maybe included in the html comments or inthe http headers
- joomla can be identifed in the respone by the **X-content-encoded-by**
- alwasy check the response header
- check the footer of the webpage
  
![finger](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/fingerjoomla.jpeg)

- we need to check the option paramter when testing joomla
- list all third party addons on joomla
# fingerprinting custom applications
- can be reversed-enginered with carfull analysis of its behvior
- we need to answer some questions
  - what is it for ?
  - does it allow user registration ?
  - does it have administration panal ?
  - does it take input from the user ?
  - what kind of input ?
  - does it accept file uploads ?
  - does it use js ,flash or ajax ?
- all this questions can be answered by crawling the web app
- we may find common software integrated with the custom code so it must be noted
- so we must surf the web app with a spider like burp
- we need to draw afunctional graph adn draw the mot important part of the web app
  
![quest](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/quest.jpeg)

- the question help build the websiteblock

![webblock](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/webblock.jpeg)

-now we study the each block and repeat the steps we want to know if each block
 - any block uses third-party app
 - any block can be accessed through login

![webblock2](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/block2.jpeg)

- to each block we add   comments and notes :
  - client side logic (js code)
  - flash applications
  - cookies (a new cookie can be added when surfing the application )
  - authorization requeried
  - forms
# mapping the Attack Surface
- Client side Validation
  - user submitted data through web forms can be validated at client side ,server side  or both
  - we need to recognize where the validation occurs to manipulate it and check for general logic flaws
  - presence of client side validation by inspecting the web page source and checking for any jsfunction triggered upon submitting
- Databse Interaction
  - user input changes the the appearance of a page due to different data is fetched from the db or new data
  - skip pages that retrieve data from db but not connected to our input
- File uploading and Downloading
  - there are wep pages that provide dynamic downloads according to parameter provided by the user
![down](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/down.jpeg)
  - this can lead to number of attacks like remote or file inclusion attacks
  - make sure to note any page that offer upload
- Display of user supplied Data
  - finding displayed user supplied data will pring XSS
- Redirections
  - server side or client side that forward the user to another web page
  - from server side
    - 301 ,302 to make redirct
    - 3xx code stands for redirct
  - From the client
    - the web broser recognize the code and redirct to the location header in the response
    - meta redirct
  - redirct are responsible for http response splitting and header manipulation attacks
- Access Control And Login Protected Page
  - will reveal the presence of retricted access to areas of the site
  - and apply authentication bypass technques
- Error messages
  - Collect all errors while serfing the web app
- Charting
![chart](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/Ewapt/blob/main/pictures/chart.jpeg)
# Enumerating Resources
- Collect Subdomains ,website structures,hiddenfiles,configration files ,and any info leaked cause of misconfigration
- use burp to automate enumrating
- Use dirbuster to check for bak files and any pther files not presented in the spider/crawling (search for backup list of extensions)
- Enumrate user accounts
# Relevent info through misconfig
