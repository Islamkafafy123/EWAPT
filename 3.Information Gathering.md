# Gather Info About Target
- info like
  - infrastructure
  - application logic
  - ips,domains,subdomains
  - virtual Hosts
- Gatther info about organization
- WHOIS Lookup
- WHOIS runs on TCP 43 port
- After WHOIS we got IP so We Go to DNS Query for the ips we foound
- DNS queries produce list called resource record

# Infrastructre
- Discover What kind of web server running
- two most commen application are apache and microsoft iis
- discovering iis we will know that server running using os in the windows server family
- apache can be linux not sure
- iis components called isapi extensions **extending functionalites of the web server** like URL rewriting
![url rewriting](https://github.com/Islamkafafy123/EWAPT-EWAPTX/blob/main/pictures/url%20rewriting.jpeg)
- we can use netcraft to fingerprint the webserver from the domain provided
- nameserver is the dns server that replies to all lookup queires regardless the **nslookup -type=NS microsoft.com**
- in case of internal webserver netcraft cannot be used we use different techniques( netcat,httprint,whatweb,wappalyzer) they probe the webserver with a series of request and compare the respone to thier database of signitures
- Netcat establish connection to the webserver and look at the server field
- look at the x-powered by header
- cookies are intersting resource that is worth checking
- Whatweb used to recognize website technologies
# fingerprinting webserver modules
