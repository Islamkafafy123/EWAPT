# Introduction
- A web service is a server side program that provides functionalities
- The main purpose of using web services is to have an interoperable architecture that is able to connect different devices and different pieces software together
- They are usually intended to facilitate:
	1. Integration between applications: application 'A' uses features implemented in application 'B'
	2. Separation within an application: front-end scripts that use web services functionalities to update the content-
- the primary goal of web services is to expose/advertise its services
  - this of a service as a server application processing parameter and returning results to each client requesting it
- Web services often depict(تصف) the actual business services provided by a company.
# Web Services Implementations
- Web services can be implemented in many different ways. The most commonly used and popular ones are:
  - ` XML-RPC` : remote procedure call (RPC) protocol that uses XML (usually over HTTP) to invoke functionalities.
  - `JSON-RPC` : remote procedure call protocol that uses JSON
  - `SOAP` : messaging protocol that uses XML and provides more functionalities of XML-RPC
  - `RESTful` : set or principles to build a web service.
- XML-RPC :
	- It works by sending HTTP requests that call a single method implemented on the remote system.
  - created in 1998 ,first web service protocol

- JSON-RPC : 
	- similer to XML-RPC but,takes less space to send the same message XML-RPC sends.
	- It has three properties:
		1. method: name of the method to invoke
		2. params: array of objects to pass as arguments
		3. id: request ID used to match the responses/requests

 - SOAP : Simple Object Access Protocol
	- Is somehow the successor of XML-RPC since it provides more functionalities such as encryption, digital signature, and routing of SOAP messages.
	- SOAP web services may also provide a Web Services Definition Language (WSDL) declaration that specifies how they may be used.
